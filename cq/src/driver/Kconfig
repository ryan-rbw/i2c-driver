config I2C_A78_PLATFORM
	tristate "ARM Cortex-A78 I2C Platform Driver"
	depends on ARM64 && OF
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	help
	  This driver supports the I2C controller found on ARM Cortex-A78
	  based embedded Linux platforms. The driver provides I2C v2.1 and
	  SMBus v2.0 compatibility with support for standard (100kHz), fast
	  (400kHz), fast-plus (1MHz), and high-speed (3.4MHz) modes.

	  Features include:
	  - DMA support for large transfers (>32 bytes)
	  - Runtime power management with autosuspend
	  - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
	  - Debug interface via debugfs
	  - 7-bit and 10-bit addressing support

	  Say Y here if you want I2C support on ARM Cortex-A78 platforms.
	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-a78-platform.

config I2C_A78_DMA
	bool "DMA support for ARM Cortex-A78 I2C"
	depends on I2C_A78_PLATFORM && DMADEVICES
	default y
	help
	  Enable DMA support for the ARM Cortex-A78 I2C driver. This allows
	  for more efficient transfers of large data blocks (32 bytes or more)
	  by offloading the data movement to a DMA engine.

	  DMA transfers provide better CPU utilization and can improve overall
	  system performance, especially for applications that frequently
	  transfer large amounts of data over I2C.

	  Say Y here to enable DMA support. Note that DMA channels must be
	  properly configured in the device tree for this feature to work.

config I2C_A78_DEBUG
	bool "Debug support for ARM Cortex-A78 I2C"
	depends on I2C_A78_PLATFORM && DEBUG_FS
	default n
	help
	  Enable debugging support for the ARM Cortex-A78 I2C driver. This
	  creates a debugfs interface that allows inspection of:
	  
	  - Current driver state and configuration
	  - Transfer statistics (bytes transferred, error counts)
	  - Hardware register values
	  - DMA buffer status

	  The debug information is accessible through:
	  /sys/kernel/debug/<device-name>/status

	  Say Y here only if you are debugging I2C issues or developing
	  the driver, as it adds some overhead.

config I2C_A78_PM_RUNTIME
	bool "Runtime power management for ARM Cortex-A78 I2C"
	depends on I2C_A78_PLATFORM && PM
	default y
	help
	  Enable runtime power management support for the ARM Cortex-A78 I2C
	  driver. This allows the I2C controller to be automatically suspended
	  when idle, reducing power consumption.

	  The driver will automatically suspend after 100ms of inactivity and
	  resume when a new I2C transfer is initiated. Clock gating and context
	  save/restore are handled transparently.

	  Say Y here to enable power management features. This is recommended
	  for battery-powered devices and systems where power efficiency is
	  important.
